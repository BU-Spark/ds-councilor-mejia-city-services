Project focus: assess where the funding is going and if it is being equitably distributed in Greater Boston. We will start with Business Assistance Funds. 
Type of data to analyze: include both qualitative and quantitative. 
Potential limitations of the project: 
The fundings’ data are not comprehensive, so far it’s only related to construction investment, doesn’t include the fundings for other categories, such as supporting local small businesses
The stages of funding need to be clearer, since we’re trying to find whether the funding is going to the correct group of people in certain neighborhood, we need to clarify whether the fund’s status should be ongoing, already distributed or is going to distribute. 
Why is this project important:
This project has significant social meaning, since equality seeks to make everyone equal, equity, on the other hand, seeks to address the underlying and systemic differences of opportunity and access to social resources. This is more important because people in each community aren't all the same. Some people need more help than others, based on income level, rent spending and other aspects.
Team’s next steps:
for each neighborhood, find the distribution of the races/ housing/ income distribution among the neighborhoods, figure out what neighborhoods need more funding. Funding categories could go to public school(attributes: household size, income); transportation, public facilities(library, park), local small business(attributes: distribution of licenses)
categorize the capital investment(what types+status)
plot maps(plot separate map of one attribute first, and then filter a certain attribute to add layer to the base map)
Data processing：transfer the zip code field in the census datasets into corresponding neighborhood
